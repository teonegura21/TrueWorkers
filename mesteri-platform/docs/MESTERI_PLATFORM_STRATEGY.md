Mesteri Platform: Foundational Blueprint - Vision, Architecture, and ExecutionVersion: 1.0Date: September 10, 2025 Authors: Teodor

AIChapter 1: Vision and Executive Summary
1.1. Executive SummaryMesteri Platform is a revolutionary digital ecosystem designed to fundamentally transform the services market in Romania. Our mission is to eradicate distrust and lack of transparency, evolving from an initial niche in home services to a universal marketplace that covers every need. We achieve this through a unique dual strategy: a "Trust Engine" that secures every aspect of the transaction and an "Inspiration Engine" that turns the application into a daily content destination, exponentially increasing user engagement and value. Through cutting-edge technology, including artificial intelligence, a microservices-based architecture, and modern financial solutions, Mesteri is not just a platform, but a new standard of quality, safety, and interaction in the services market.
1.2. Long-Term VisionTo become the "super-app" of choice in Romania for any service. When a user thinks "I need...", whether it's a painter, a car mechanic, a notary, or a graphic designer, the natural and instinctive answer will be "I'll look on Mesteri." We will achieve this status not just by being a contact list, but by being a trusted partner throughout the entire lifecycle of a need: from inspiration and planning to secure execution and validation.1.3. The Fundamental Problem AddressedThe services market in Romania is deeply fragmented and suffers from a chronic crisis of trust. This problem has two facets:For the Client: The fear of fraud (paying an advance without the work being completed), poor quality of work, hidden costs, and the lack of a dispute resolution mechanism.For the Honest Professional: Unfair competition from amateurs, the difficulty of differentiating through quality, the risk of non-payment from clients, and the lack of modern promotional tools.Existing platforms (classified ads, social media groups) exacerbate these problems, acting as mere "bridges" over a chasm of distrust, without providing a solid foundation.

Chapter 2: The Strategic Pillars of the PlatformThe Mesteri Platform is built on two main pillars that work in symbiosis to create an unparalleled experience.
2.1. Pillar I: The Trust EngineThis is the technical and contractual foundation that guarantees safety. It is composed of three inseparable systems:Rigorous Verification (KYC/KYB - Know Your Customer/Business):What it is: A mandatory process through which every service provider (sole proprietor, LLC, or individual) is validated.How it works: Using a specialized partner like Stripe Connect, we automatically collect and verify official documents (ID card, tax registration certificate). Only professionals whose identity is confirmed can receive payments.Benefit: We eliminate anonymity and guarantee that users interact with real and legitimate entities.Secure Escrow Payments:What it is: A mechanism whereby the client's payment is held by the platform in a secure account and released to the professional only after the client digitally confirms that the service has been performed to their satisfaction.How it works: Through the "Separate Charges and Transfers" logic in Stripe Connect, funds are held in the platform's account and automatically transferred upon fulfillment of the conditions, minus the Mesteri commission.Benefit: Zero financial risk for the client. 100% payment guarantee for the professional.100% Verified Reviews:What it is: A system where the right to leave a review is technically conditional on the completion of a transaction.How it works: The API endpoint for adding a review becomes active for a client only after the backend confirms that a successful payout has occurred to the professional for the respective project.Benefit: We eliminate fake reviews (both positive and negative) and create a reputation system based exclusively on meritocracy and real experiences.
2.2. Pillar II: The Inspiration EngineThis is the engagement layer that transforms Mesteri from a tool into a destination.Vertical Content Feed (TikTok/Reels Style):What it is: A central section in the app where professionals showcase their work through short videos and images ("before and after," work process, completed projects).Strategic Purpose:Retention: Gives users a reason to open the app daily, even when they don't have an immediate need.Demand Generation: Inspires users to start new projects they hadn't considered.Organic Promotion: Acts as a dynamic portfolio and social proof of quality, far more powerful than a simple photo gallery.Automatic Content Generation:What it is: A feature that minimizes marketing effort for professionals.How it works: Upon project completion, the system asks both parties for consent. If given, it uses the images uploaded during the project to automatically compose a draft post ("Bathroom renovation project completed for a client in Bucharest!"). The professional just needs to press "Publish."Hyper-Personalized Recommendations (AI):What it is: The use of a self-hosted Language Model (LLM) to understand each user's aesthetic preferences.How it works: The system analyzes the user's interactions with the feed (what they save, what they watch most). When that user posts a "kitchen renovation" job, the AI can proactively suggest professionals who have posted work in a similar style (e.g., modern, minimalist, rustic) and have been successful with other users of similar tastes.

Chapter 3: Business Model and Financial Innovations
3.1. Main Revenue StreamThe primary income comes from a percentage commission (target 5-15%) applied to the labor value of each successfully brokered transaction. The model is perfectly aligned with user success: the commission is charged only when the client is satisfied and the professional gets paid.
3.2. Financial Growth AcceleratorsBNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later) Integration - e.g., Klarna:Mechanism: The client can choose to pay in installments. Klarna pays the full amount into the Mesteri escrow account, and the client repays the installments to Klarna. The credit risk is completely transferred to the BNPL partner.Strategic Impact: Increases the average transaction value by allowing clients to undertake more ambitious and expensive projects.Premium Services for Professionals (Phase 2):Promoted Profile: The ability to pay for increased visibility in the feed or search results.Data Analytics: An advanced dashboard with insights into post and profile performance.

Chapter 4: Detailed Technical Architecture

4.1. Architectural PhilosophyWe are building a modern, scalable, and resilient platform based on the principles of containerization and orchestration. Each component is decoupled and can be developed, tested, and scaled independently.
4.2. Tech Stack ComponentsMobile Apps (Client & Pro): Flutter, for rapid, cross-platform development (iOS & Android) and a fluid interface.Backend: Node.js with the NestJS framework (TypeScript), chosen for performance, scalability, and a mature ecosystem. It will run in a Docker container.Database: PostgreSQL, a robust and reliable solution for relational data. It will run in its own Docker container.Payment Processor: Stripe Connect, the all-in-one solution for payments, escrow-like logic, and KYC/KYB verification.File Storage: An object storage service, such as Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage, to host the images and videos from the feed and verification documents.AI Service: An open-source LLM (e.g., Llama 3, Mistral), optimized for inference speed and running in a Docker container on a GPU-enabled server.
4.3. Deployment Strategy: Docker, Kubernetes & CI/CDContainerization (Docker): All services (NestJS, PostgreSQL, LLM, stripe-mock) are packaged in Docker containers. This ensures a consistent development environment and eliminates "it works on my machine" problems.Orchestration (Kubernetes - K8s): For the production environment, we will use Kubernetes to automatically manage the containers.Auto-Scaling: K8s will automatically add or remove backend containers based on traffic.Self-Healing: If a container fails, K8s will automatically restart it, ensuring almost 100% availability.Zero-Downtime Deployments: Updates to a new version of the application will be rolled out gradually (rolling updates), without the service becoming unavailable.CI/CD Pipeline (Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery):Continuous Integration (CI): On every code change pushed to Git, an automated system (e.g., GitHub Actions) will build the Docker image and run a full suite of automated tests, using stripe-mock to simulate payments.Continuous Delivery (CD): If all tests pass, the system will automatically push the new Docker image to Kubernetes, which will initiate the update process in production.

Chapter 5: Phased Implementation PlanPhase 1: Building the Transactional Foundation (Months 1-5) - MVPObjective: Launch a functional product that validates the "Trust Engine."Key Tasks:Develop the backend with essential modules (Authentication, Projects, Offers).Deeply integrate with Stripe Connect to implement the full
