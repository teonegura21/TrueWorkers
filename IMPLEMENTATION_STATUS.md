## 1️⃣ DATABASE ARCHITECTURE

### ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Core Working)

```sql
-- Fully functional tables:
✅ users (Firebase-based authentication)
✅ user_profiles
✅ craftsman_profiles
✅ jobs
✅ offers
✅ projects
✅ milestones
✅ contracts
✅ conversations
✅ messages
✅ conversation_participants
✅ reviews
✅ notifications
✅ payments
✅ wallets
✅ withdrawals
✅ verification_requests
✅ documents
✅ verification_badges
✅ inspiration_posts (NEW - not in blueprint)
✅ attachments
✅ project_events
✅ search_history (NEW - implemented)
✅ saved_craftsmen (NEW - implemented)
✅ analytics_events (NEW - implemented)
```

### 🟡 PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION

```sql
-- Different or simplified from blueprint:

Blueprint: users (with password_hash, JWT-based)
Current:   users (Firebase UID, no password_hash)
Status:    🔄 Using Firebase Auth instead of custom JWT

Blueprint: craft_categories (hierarchical with translations)
Current:   JobCategory enum (simple categorization)
Status:    🟡 Simplified - no hierarchical structure

Blueprint: content_posts (TikTok-style feed with geolocation)
Current:   inspiration_posts (basic before/after showcase)
Status:    🟡 Functional but missing advanced features

Blueprint: craftsman_crafts (many-to-many relationship)
Current:   specialties (string array in craftsman_profiles)
Status:    🟡 Simplified relationship model
```

### ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

```sql
-- Missing from blueprint:

❌ support_tickets table
❌ retention_policies (partially exists but not fully utilized)
❌ attachment_links (exists but minimal usage)
```

### Key Database Differences

| Feature | Blueprint | Current | Impact |
|---------|-----------|---------|--------|
| Auth System | Password hash + JWT | Firebase Auth | ✅ More secure, easier |
| Geolocation | PostGIS (GEOGRAPHY) | Lat/Lng floats + Haversine | ✅ Implemented (upgraded) |
| Categories | Hierarchical tree | Flat enum | ❌ Less flexible |
| User Types | Separate enum | Combined enum | ✅ Simpler |
